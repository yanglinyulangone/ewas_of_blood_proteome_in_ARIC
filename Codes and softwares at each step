**Step 1: Preprocessing and quality control of DNA methylation data**
Adapted from the CPACOR framework and the Infinium preprocessing pipeline (https://github.com/genepi-freiburg/Infinium-preprocessing). The pipeline was executed twice: in the first run, outlier samples were identified; these samples were then removed prior to the second run. The preprocessed data from the the second run was used for the following analysis. Both β-values and M-values were generated, and β-values were used for all analyses.
The pipeline includes the following main steps:
1. IDAT files were processed to generate an RGSet object.
2. Background correction was performed, white blood cell (WBC) subtypes were estimated, and 56 SNP probes were extracted.
3. Probes in the RGSet were classified into six groups for probe-type–specific preprocessing: Type I Green M, Type I Green U, Type I Red M, Type I Red U, Type II Green, and Type II Red.
4. Control probes were extracted and used to derive principal components (PCs) representing technical variation, which were included as covariates in downstream linear regression models.
5. Detection P-values were extracted and used to filter low-quality probes.
6. Probe-level data were summarized to CpG marker–level data.
7. CpG markers were stratified into autosomal, X-chromosomal, and Y-chromosomal groups, and subsequent preprocessing steps were performed separately for each group.
8. High-level quality control (QC) was conducted by calculating detection P-values and filtering probes and samples based on call rate thresholds.
9. Low-level QC included identification of sex mismatches and filtering CpG markers based on probe-type–specific call rates.
10. Stratified quantile normalization was applied to β-values from autosomal and sex chromosome probes.
11. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on control probe intensities to assess technical batch effects.
12. The interquartile range (IQR) was calculated to identify and remove outlier CpG markers.
13. A final cleaned dataset of DNA methylation β-values was generated for downstream analy

**Step 5: Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of circulating proteins**


**Step 6: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of pQTMs**

**Step 7: Decomposition of protein variance by cis-pQTMs and cis-pQTLs**
